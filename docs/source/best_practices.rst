Best Practices
==============

Consider this page as a documented form of whatever wisdom we, as a community,
have gained over time.

If you find something helpful, which you think would be a great addition here,
please feel free to edit `this page <https://github.com/amu-oss/whattodo>`_ and
send a PR.

Start using DuckDuckGo
----------------------

There will be many times in a day when you will need some help, may be to solve
a problem, or to learn a new thing. Before you go and ask for help, you should
first search for a solution. Most of the times, you will find the answer
yourself. We suggest everyone to use `DuckDuckGo <duck.com>`_ search engine.
This particular search engine does not track you, and is focused to protect your
privacy.

If you open the site for the first time, it will show you ways you can enable it
as the default search engine in your browser. That should be the first thing to
do. Go ahead, and enable DuckDuckGo as the default search engine.

To know more why should you use DuckDuckGo, read their `privacy page
<https://duckduckgo.com/privacy>`_.

If you're concerned about your privacy, and want to surf the internet
anonymously, we recommend using Tor Browser.
